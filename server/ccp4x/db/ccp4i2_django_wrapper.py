def using_django_pm(func):
    """
    Decorator to temporarily replace the CCP4ProjectsManager instance with a
    CCP4i2DjangoProjectsManager instance while the decorated function is executed.
    This decorator is useful for ensuring that the decorated function uses the
    Django-based project manager instead of the default one.
    Args:
        func (callable): The function to be decorated.
    Returns:
        callable: The wrapped function with the temporary project manager replacement.
    The decorator performs the following steps:
    1. Logs a debug message before the function is called.
    2. Saves the current CCP4ProjectsManager instance.
    3. Replaces the CCP4ProjectsManager instance with a CCP4i2DjangoProjectsManager instance.
    4. Executes the decorated function.
    5. If an exception occurs, logs the exception and prints the traceback.
    6. Restores the original CCP4ProjectsManager instance.
    7. Logs a warning message after the function is called.
